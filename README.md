# World_Pricket_Primarily_Analysis
World Cricket primarily an examination of players worldwide based on the 2022 World Cup data set,
with the goal of analyzing players and creating the world's greatest team. 

I'm using the Microsoft Power Bi tool for database and visualization in this investigation. I have made a daisbord with lots of information that is quite helpful in player selection.
There are selection criteria for players, including bowlers, all-rounders, and openers.To make this kind of selection method simple and understandable, I have made multiple dashboards.
