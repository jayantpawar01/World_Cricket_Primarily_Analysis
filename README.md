# World_Pricket_Primarily_Analysis
World Cricket primarily examines players worldwide based on the 2022 World Cup data set, to analyze players and create the world's greatest team.

I'm using the Microsoft Power BI tool for database and visualization in this investigation. I have made a dashboard with lots of information that is quite helpful in player selection. There are selection criteria for players, including bowlers, all-rounders, and openers. I have made multiple dashboards to make this kind of selection method simple and understandable.
